# Smart Home Management

_This can run on LAN but it's currently designed for the Cloud as well._

A server that integrates with your home's devices. The main goal of this project is to let your home's guests use your smart devices without logging in or downloading any apps, as long as they are inside your home.
Another motivation is to restrict the control users' have when managing the devives. Instead of having to set the AC mode, temperature, etc they only need to press a Heat or Cool button.
The whole system is highly modifiable with a config file as the source of truth, see more on [config file section](./server/README.md#Config).
